## Welcome to the VolunteerMD Website

VolunteerMD is a clinical volunteering portal designed to help aspiring medical students easily find and apply to clinical volunteer opportunities.

This is currently a prototype website with mock opportunities to display the features of this website.

Some features include
- Filter clinical volunteering opportunities by subject, location, and time commitment
- View requirements and prerequisites of volunteering opportunities (e.g. Police Background Check, 18+, etc.)
- Save favorite opportunities to return to later on
- Contact form for inquiries

## Note
- VolunteerMD is currently in early stages of development as we begin our search for volunteering opportunities.
- We are continuing to build the algorithms required to fully power the matching process.

For questions or feedback, please reach out at volunteermd.org@gmail.com.

Disclaimer: Majority of the coding behind this website was AI generated.
